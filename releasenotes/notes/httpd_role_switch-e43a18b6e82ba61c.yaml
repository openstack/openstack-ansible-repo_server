features:
  - |
    Added variable ``repo_server_directory_root`` which by default points to
    ``/var/www/repo`` and used instead of ``repo_service_home_folder`` as
    Apache DirectoryRoot for the virtual host.

upgrade:
  - |
    The ``repo_server`` role was switched to using a standalone HTTPD role
    from the in-role HTTPD deployment.
  - |
    In case of using custom path for the repo server vhost, please ensure
    to use ``repo_server_directory_root`` variable instead of
    ``repo_service_home_folder``.

deprecations:
  - |
    Variables for the ``repo_server`` role related to Apache (HTTPD)
    configuration, like ``repo_apache_*``, as well as some ``repo_pki_``
    and ``repo_ssl_*`` were deprecated and have no effect now on due to
    migration to a standalone ``httpd`` role.
    Please, reffer to the ``httpd`` role for more details on how to
    manage deprecated settings.
